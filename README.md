# Stock Pattern Assistant

Stock Pattern Assistant is a personal research tool for exploring historical stock price and volume behavior using only public market data. The project is structured like an open-source library so it can run locally and stay easy to reason about.

Future phases will incorporate GPT-style language models to describe historical price runs and correlate them with any notable public news, but the tool will always stay focused on summarizing past market activity rather than predicting the future.

This project does **not** provide financial advice, trading recommendations, or guidance on what to buy or sell. It is intended purely for research and educational purposes.

**Important Note**:
**SPA is not a forecasting or trading system. It does not generate buy/sell signals or predictions. SPA only analyzes historical price behavior and run structure for research and pattern-analysis purposes.**
